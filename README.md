<p align="justify">
  Magit is an interface to the version control system
  <a href="http://git-scm.com">Git</a>, implemented as an
  <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs">Emacs</a> package.
  Magit aspires to be a complete Git porcelain.  While we cannot
  (yet) claim, that Magit wraps and improves upon each and every Git
  command, it is complete enough to allow even experienced Git users
  to perform almost all of their daily version control tasks directly
  from within Emacs.  While many fine Git clients exist, only Magit
  and Git itself deserve to be called porcelains.

Magit 2.1.0 will be released on the 1th of July
===============================================

- To install the soon to be obsolete `1.4.2` release, follow
  [these](https://github.com/magit/magit/wiki/Installation) old
  instructions.

- To install the `2.0.50` pre-release now, follow [these][install]
  instructions.  Note that until `2.1.0` has been released you have
  to install directly from the development repository.

- If you are the maintainer of a package that depends on Magit, then
  please start using `2.0.50` now and try to adapt your package before
  the 1th of July.  Thanks.

- For more information see [this][roadmap] issue.

Before you install the new version (regardless of whether you install
the `2.0.50` pre-release now, or the `2.1.0` release once that has
arrived) you have to **first uninstall `1.4.0`**.  See [this][update]
page for more information.
